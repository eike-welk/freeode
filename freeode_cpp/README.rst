                            The Old Compiler
###############################################################################

This is the source code of the old compiler, which is written in in C++. 
The old compiler is much more simple and limited than the current compiler. 
However in its simple and limited nature, the old compile was maybe a better design than the current compiler.

A language and a compiler for simulation of continuous systems. 
This means integration of differential equations (ODE). 
Both lumped and distributed variables (PDE) are possible. 
The ability to solve DAEs is a long term goal.

Further goals are:

-Graphical tools.
-Unstructured grids and arbitrarily shaped regions for PDEs.
-A companion language for data acquisition and control where simulation objects could be embedded.
-Integration of more problem specific languages e.g.: chemical reaction dynamics.
