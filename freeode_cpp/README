A language and a compiler for simulation of continuous systems. This means integration of differential equations (ODE). Both lumped and distributed variables (PDE) are possible. The ability to solve DAEs is a long term goal.

Further goals are:
-Graphical tools.
-Unstructured grids and arbitrarily shaped regions for PDEs.
-A companion language for data acquisition and control where simulation objects could be embedded.
-Integration of more problem specific languages e.g.: chemical reaction dynamics.
