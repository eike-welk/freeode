YAC is Yet Another Calculator. It has been written as a vehicle with which to
investigate some of the Spirit parser framework's powerful facilities. As such,
I've put at least as much effort into the documentation as I put into writing
the code. My primary hope is that this documentation will prove useful to those
thinking of using closures, lambda functions, lazy functions and the functor
parser in their own code.

The source code, to be found in the src directory can be compiled in a single
pass. Here, on a Linux machine I compile it with:

    g++ -I$HOME/boost/cvs -o yac yac.cpp

The html documentation, in the doc directory has been generated from the
yac.txt master file using a patched version of Joel de Guzman's QuickDoc
utility. The patch enables QuickDoc to generate fully-conformant XHTML 1.1 code
and is to be found in this directory.

You want to know more? Then go read the docs ;-)

Enjoy!
